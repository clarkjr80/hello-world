# hello-world

Greetings from the Land of Lorn

We the people of Lorn are a humble race.  Peace and tranquillity is our general aura.  Community and social interaction are praised only second to a strong family bond.  We exist on the temperate plains of the planet Faitaar, eighteen parsects from our star, Villanovia.  Our planet resides in what would be referenced as a "Goldilocks Zone"
